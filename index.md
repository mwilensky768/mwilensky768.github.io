## About Me

Hi! I'm Mike Wilensky. Welcome to my home page! I am a radio astronomer working
at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Manchester,
mostly focused on 21-cm cosmology. I'm really into data analysis; it's so cool 
that we can make instruments that tell us about the world in ways we could never 
sense on our own. What's more is it all seems to cohere logically! That might 
say more about our ability to identify logical coherence than our ability to make 
something logical...At any rate, lately I've been really into Bayesian inference 
i.e. "probability as logic" and applying it to actual data sets. I also really 
enjoy resistance training, cooking tasty food, hiking, camping, video games, and 
just sitting around, having a laugh.

## Research Interests

- **Bayesian Inference:** Probability as logic. See a textbook by E.T. Jaynes.
- **Cosmology:** What is the structure of the universe on large scales and over vast times?

## News

- **{October 2023}** New paper published! This one is a power specturm upper limit with the MWA. We found lots of faint RFI in our data, and the community will have to think about the implications.
- **[July 2023]** I won an award! Best talk at the MWA 10 year anniversary project meeting.
